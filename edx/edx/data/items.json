[{"startDate": ["16 Sep 2014"], "about": ["<span itemprop=\"description\"><p><strong>The course described below will start September 16, 2014.</strong></p>\n<p>8.EFTx is an online version of MIT's graduate Effective Field Theory course. The course follows the MIT on-campus class 8.851 as it was given by Professor Iain Stewart in the Fall of 2013, and includes his video lectures, resource material on various effective theories, and a series of problems to facilitate learning the material. Anyone can register for the online version of the course, and students at MIT or Harvard can also register for 8.S851 for course credit.</p>\n<p>Effective field theory (EFT) provides a fundamental framework to describe physical systems with quantum field theory. In this course you will learn both how to construct EFTs and how to apply them in a variety of situations. We will cover the majority of the common tools that are used by different effective field theories. In particular: identifying degrees of freedom and symmetries, formulating power counting expansions (both dimensional and non-dimensional), field redefinitions, bottom-up and top-down effective theories, fine-tuned effective theories, matching and Wilson coefficients, reparameterization invariance, and various examples of advanced renormalization group techniques. Examples of effective theories we will cover are the Standard Model as an effective field theory, integrating out the massive W, Z, Higgs, and top, chiral perturbation theory, non-relativistic effective field theories including those with a large scattering length, static sources and Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), and a theory for collider physics, the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET).</p>\n<h2>\n\tCourse Flow</h2>\n<p>Since this is an advanced graduate physics course, you will find that self motivation and interaction with others is essential to learning the material. The purpose of the online course is to set you up with a foundation, to teach you to speak the language of EFT, and to connect you with other students and researchers that are interested in learning or broadening their exposure to this subject. Each week you will complete automatically graded homework problems to test your understanding and to help you master the material. You are expected to discuss the homework with other people in the class, but your online responses must be done individually. To facilitate these interactions there will be a forum for student-to-student discussions, with threads to cover different topics, and moderators with experience in this field. Student learning and discussions will also be prompted by questions posed after each lecture topic.</p>\n<p>There will be no tests or final exam, but at the end of the course each student will give a 30 minute presentation on an EFT topic of their choosing. The subject of effective field theory is rich and diverse, and far broader than we will be able to cover in a single course. The presentations will create an opportunity for you to learn about additional subjects beyond those in lecture from your fellow students. To facilitate this learning opportunity, each student will be required to watch and grade eight presentations from among their fellow students. Of these eight, you will view 5 presentations that will be chosen for you, and you will view at least 3 more that you choose yourself from among the available topics.</p>\n<p>Since this is a graduate course we anticipate that learning the subject, and having the 8.EFTx materials available as an online resource will be more valuable to most of you than obtaining a grade. Therefore anyone who registers for the course will be able to retain access to the course materials after the course has ended. Since some of you may find a grade useful, we will compute a grade for everyone by using a combination of homework problems (50%) and your final research presentation project (50%). \u00a0For many of the course elements you may work at your own pace. The presentation project will be due December 16th.\u00a0 For those following the suggested schedule there is a one-week break over the Christmas &amp; New Years holiday, and two homework problems that are due in January.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n<p>In addressing the material in this course we will assume familiarity with Quantum Field Theory, at the level of Peskin &amp; Schroeder or Srednicki, such as might be obtained from having taken a graduate course on this subject. In particular we will assume knowledge of abelian and nonabelian gauge theories, constructing Lagrangians, renormalization, dimensional regularization, and the calculation of observables like cross sections. At the start of the course a review will be provided for material on the renormalization group and for material outlining the Standard Model of particle and nuclear physics as a quantum field theory.</p>\n<p>MIT students are expected to spend 12 hours per week on 8.EFTx, and if you have the necessary background knowledge, we estimate that it will also take you 12 hours per week to do well.</p></span>"], "name": ["Effective Field Theory"], "url": "https://edx.org//course/mitx/mitx-8-eftx-effective-field-theory-2306", "school": ["MITx"], "length": ["18 weeks"], "prereqs": ["A graduate level course in Quantum Field Theory."], "video": ["http://www.youtube.com/v/6MuvoSpRGQs?version=3&amp;autohide=1"], "courseCode": ["8.EFTx"], "instructor": ["Iain Stewart", "Saif Rayyan", "Daniel Kolodrubetz", "Evangelos Sfakianakis"], "effort": ["10 - 14 hours/week"]},

Designed to promote discussion and dialogue while contributing to the discourse surrounding the concept of the vernacular, this course will challenge the perception of tradition and stimulate a deeper analysis of one\u2019s local environment.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, <em>vernacular</em> implies a distinct local expression in building or language, and raises questions of identity, tradition, and transmission. This course presents a broad understanding of the vernacular with emphasis on the built heritage of Asia, including topics such as indigenous building materials, the ideas of use and tradition and the vernacular landscape. Much of the Asian vernacular built heritage emerges from the assimilation of different cultures with immigration and trading patterns circulating throughout the region, providing both explicit and subtle references to the countries of their origin. As such, Asia serves as an ideal platform for the investigation into vernacular systems around the world. While the various countries that play host to the course\u2019s discussions are found mainly in the Asian region, the diversity of cultures represented allows for students from any background to find common ground and familiarize themselves with the topics covered, increasing their understanding of vernacular architecture in their own surroundings.</p>\n<p>This is a 5-week introductory course with videos, readings, interactive engagements, assessments and discussion forums.

Where diseases were clearly understood, and where treatments obviously worked on most patients, such as penicillin for pneumonia, there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions, the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial.</p>\n<p>As the cost of developing new treatments grew, it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease, with perfect adherence, treated by the best doctors, under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases, imperfect adherence, ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them, receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions.</p>\n<p>In this MOOC, we are going to study this mismatch, and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug, at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically, this drug, intended to reduce a problem in individuals, ended up causing more of the same problem in the population!</p>\n<p>After we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials, we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials, which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research \u2013 to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost, and how they are experienced by the recipients.</p></span>"], "name": ["Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trials in Health Care"], "url": "https://edx.org//course/kix/kix-kipractihx-pragmatic-randomized-1541", "school": ["KIx"], "length": ["6 weeks"], "prereqs": ["Students should have some experience in the health sector, either as professionals, data analysts or in policy, clinical trials or program implementation.

Through better use of data, leaders are able to plan and enact strategies with greater clarity and confidence. Data drives increased organizational efficiency and a competitive advantage. Simply, analytics provide new insight and actionable intelligence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In education, the use of data and analytics to improve learning is referred to as <em>learning analytics</em>. Analytics have not yet made the impact on education that they have made in other fields. That\u2019s starting to change. Software companies, researchers, educators, and university leaders recognize the value of data in improving not only teaching and learning, but the entire education sector. In particular, learning analytics enables universities, schools, and corporate training departments to improve the quality of learning and overall competitiveness. Research communities such as the International Educational Data Mining Society (IEDMS) and the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) are developing promising models for improving learner success through predictive analytics, machine learning, recommender systems (content and social), network analysis, tracking the development of concepts through social systems, discourse analysis, and intervention and support strategies. The era of data and analytics in learning is just beginning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Data, Analytics, and Learning </strong>provides an introduction to learning analytics and how it is being deployed in various contexts in education, including to support automated intervention, to inform instructors, and to promote scientific discovery. Additionally, we will discuss tools and methods, what skills data scientists need in education, and how to protect student privacy and other rights. The course will provide a broad overview of the field, suitable for a broad audience. Learners will explore the logic of analytics, the basics of finding, cleaning, and using educational data, predictive models, text analysis, and activity graphs and social networks. We will discuss use of analytics in data domains such as log files and text data.\u00a0 Tableau Software is partnering with University of Texas Arlington to provide analytics software to course participants as well as technical support and guest lectures. Additional software will be introduced and discussed throughout the course.</p>\n<p><strong>How this course works:</strong></p>\n<p>This course will experiment with multiple learning pathways. It has been structured to allow learners to take various pathways through learning content - either in the existing edX format or in a social competency-based and self-directed format. Learners will have access to pathways that support both beginners, and more advanced students, with pointers to additional advanced resources. In addition to interactions within the edX platform, learners will be encouraged to engage in distributed conversations on social media such as blogs and Twitter.</p></span>"], "name": ["Data, Analytics and Learning"], "url": "https://edx.org//course/utarlingtonx/utarlingtonx-link5-10x-data-analytics-2186", "school": ["UTArlingtonX"], "length": ["9 weeks"], "prereqs": [], "video": [], "courseCode": ["LINK5.10x"], "instructor": ["George Siemens", "Carolyn Ros\u00e9", "Dragan Gasevic", "Ryan Baker"], "effort": ["5 hours/week"]},
{"startDate": ["15 Oct 2014"], "about": ["<span itemprop=\"description\"><p>Students will question for themselves the meaning of human freedom, responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri's <em>Divine Comedy</em>. <em>The Comedy</em>, which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the question, \u201cwho am I?\u201d Dante, as a Florentine, a poet, a lover, and religious believer struggled with the same question in each facet of his life before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person.</p>\n<p>As a 21st century reader, you will encounter the poem in a novel online environment that integrates knowledge from the disciplines of literature, history, psychology, philosophy, and theology with modern technology. You will be guided through the poem by means of the \"MyDante\" Project, an online environment developed by Professor Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), which will aid your own contemplative engagement with the poem. Alone and with the edX community, you will reflect on both Dante's interpretation of freedom and how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and the problem of finding appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern life.</p>\n<p>You, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante's poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and is genuinely contemplative. You will discover that contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning, and even beyond the traditional allegorical and interpreted meaning, to apply every possible meaning contained in the text to your own life and identity. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as\u00a0<span>you journey toward a richer understanding of your freedom, identity and responsibility as a person.</span></p>\n<p><strong>This module is the first of three modules that compose the full course.

This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.\u00a0 Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law \u2013 in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward \u2013 to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor \u2013 a natural d\u00e0o.</p>\n<p>We will look at two rival directions this natural d\u00e0o model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the d\u00e0o of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance \u2013 Medieval Chinese Buddhism.</p>\n<p>Although Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.</p></span>"], "name": ["Humanity and Nature in Chinese Thought"], "url": "https://edx.org//course/hkux/hkux-hku03x-humanity-nature-chinese-1981", "school": ["HKUx"], "length": ["10 weeks"], "prereqs": [], "video": ["http://www.youtube.com/v/M1LBMzXXKq4?version=3&amp;autohide=1"], "courseCode": ["HKU03x"], "instructor": ["Chad Hansen"], "effort": ["2-3 hours/week "]},

This course on the basics of crop production will discuss why yields in some parts of the world are lagging behind and identify the agro-ecological drivers that shape the wide diversity of production systems. Furthermore, key issues relating to bridging of yield gaps and how these link to different visions of sustainability will be explored.</p>\n<p>This online course will be of great interest to international students and educated public from different backgrounds, both professionally and culturally, to enrich their views and action perspectives related to global food security and food systems.

In many parts of the world we take the availability of these services for granted. Without conscious reflection on the technological systems that bring these services to where we use them, we are becoming increasingly dependent on a secure, uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy, water, transport, telecommunication and information services. They create the conditions for liveability and economic development. However, today's infrastructure systems are in a process of drastic change, as they are becoming more and more web-based, transnational and privatized, while new technologies are on their way. The outcome of these changes is difficult to predict.</p>\n<p>In this course we will explore the challenges of infrastructure design, management and governance for the future. Some of the questions that will be addressed:</p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tWhat are the major changes and drivers when it comes to infrastructure development?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWhat makes infrastructure networks vulnerable and how do we manage these risks in the future?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tHow can their reliability and quality-of-service be improved?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWill they become accessible for all global citizens, always and everywhere?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWill they remain affordable for future generations?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWill they exhaust the natural environment?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWill established infrastructure systems be disrupted by technological innovations?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tHow about security and privacy?</li>\n</ul><p>In this course you will learn to look at these challenges from a new combined engineering and social science perspective. We will explain, for example, how public values are expressed in infrastructure design, and how regulation dictates technology choices. It is all about dealing with complexity in the design, management and governance of infrastructure.</p>\n<p>If you are interested or involved in the functioning of today's and tomorrow's (next generation) infrastructures, this course is an exceptional learning opportunity, whether you are a student or a professional. You will be interacting with peers all over the world and we will highlight a large number of case studies.</p>\n<p>In the follow-up course, starting in September 2014, you will have the opportunity to study a specific infrastructure in more detail and explore ways to improve its resilience, security, affordability and flexibility. What is the potential of so-called smart grids? How to design infrastructure for the smart cities of the future?</p>\n<p>The course is based on the results of an extensive and renowned international research programme titled '<a href=\"http://www.nextgenerationinfrastructures.eu/index.php?pageID=1&amp;language=en\" target=\"_blank\">Next Generation Infrastructures</a>' (NGInfra).

Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited.</p>\n<p>In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors including topics such as probabilistic state estimation, linear control, and path planning. You will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings, how to navigate along a series of waypoints, and how to plan collision free trajectories. The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. The programming exercises will require you to write small code snippets in Python to make a quadrotor fly in simulation.</p>\n<p>This course is intended for graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. The course is based on the TUM lecture \u201cVisual Navigation for Flying Robots\u201d which received the TUM TeachInf best lecture award in 2012 and 2013.

All stress isn\u2019t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one\u2019s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. This captures the notion of being from the inside out, which is a phrase that highlights the importance of promoting core resilience skills, strategies, and routines among early childhood educators. In turn, resilient people are more capable of creating and maintaining nurturing, supportive, and effective learning environments while also optimizing their own wellbeing and love for both the big and small things in life.</p>\n<p>By the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.</p>\n<p><u>Course goal:</u></p>\n<p>The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person.

If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen \"just by chance\"? These are some of the questions we will address in the course.</p>\n<p>We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions.</p>\n<p>Be warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble.

Unfortunately for you, lending money is definitely a risky activity: there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. For example you may expect losses in your portfolio because of the default of your counterpart. Or, in a less extreme situation, the credit quality of your counterpart may deteriorate according to some rating system, so that your loan becomes more and more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself. According to the Basel Agreements, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks, together with market risk and operational risk, a bank (or another regulated financial institution) has to face when operating on the markets. As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to cope with it are fundamental in the world of today. The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to credit risk modeling and hedging.

That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.</p>\n<p><em>Image: Hands at the Cuevas de las Manos upon R\u00edo Pinturas, near the town of Perito Moreno in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.

Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. \u201cFuture Cities\u201d aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.</p>\n<p>The only way to better understand the city is by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different representations, properties and impact factors of the urban system.

We will open a holistic view on existing and new cities, with a focus on Asia. Data-driven approaches for the development of the future city will be studied, based on crowdsourcing and sensing.

This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems. It also discusses the basic ideas behind the experimental realization of quantum computers, including the prospects for adiabatic quantum optimization and the D-Wave controversy.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p></span>"], "name": ["Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation"], "url": "https://edx.org//course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-cs-191x-quantum-mechanics-1033", "school": ["UC BerkeleyX"], "length": ["9 weeks"], "prereqs": ["A strong background in basic linear algebra, including vectors, matrices, complex numbers, inner products, eigenvalues and eigenvectors (a simple diagnostic quiz will help you assess your background).

Passing the online version of this course will guarantee you an MITx certificate of achievement The course is on electricity and magnetism which are at the heart of Maxwell's equations. We will study electric fields, magnetic fields, electromagnetic forces, conductors and dielectrics, electromagnetic waves, and the nature of light. This online version follows the MIT on-campus class as it was given by the renowned Professor Walter Lewin in the spring of 2002, and includes his video lectures and problem solving sessions. Professor Lewin, proclaimed \"a Web Star\" by The New York Times, has supplemented his lectures specifically for 8.02x by including interactive questions to help students check their understanding during the lectures themselves. Also, the course uses prize-winning animations and interactive simulations developed under the leadership of Professor John Belcher for MIT's Technology Enabled Active Learning (TEAL) classroom.</p>\n<p>In addition to the basic concepts of Electromagnetism, a vast variety of interesting topics are covered in this course including: Lightning, Electric Shock Treatment, Electrocardiograms, Metal Detectors, Musical Instruments, Magnetic Levitation, Bullet Trains, Electric Motors, Radios, TV, Car Coils, Superconductivity, Aurora Borealis, Rainbows, Radio Telescopes, Interferometers, Particle Accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, Mass Spectrometers, Red Sunsets, Blue Skies, Haloes around Sun and Moon, Color Perception, Doppler Effect, Big-Bang Cosmology.</p>\n<p>You will complete automatically graded weekly homework problems and a series of exams using multiple choice, numerical and symbolic questions to test your understanding and to help you master the material. Lectures are interspersed with questions that must be answered before advancing to the next lecture segment. There is a moderated forum for student-to-student threaded discussions. While homework deadlines will be strictly enforced, the lowest homework grade will be dropped. Your grade will be based on interactive questions during the lectures (5%), homework problems and simulations (20%), three midterm exams (15% each), and the final exam (30%). Depending on what percentage of all the points you get, your grade will be as follows: A (more than 85%), B (70-85%), C (60-70%). At least 60% of the points must be obtained to qualify for a certificate of mastery.</p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT THE LECTURES</strong><br>\n\tLewin's lectures at MIT are legendary.

That question is at the core of <em>The Ancient Greek Hero</em>, which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging, highly comparative way.</p>\n<p>The classical Greeks' concepts of Heroes and the \"heroic\" were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.</p>\n<p>In Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship \u2013 a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.</p>\n<p>The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more, including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue \"On Heroes\" by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation, with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda, including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach's opera <em>Tales of Hoffman</em> to Ridley Scott's science fiction classic <em>Blade Runner</em>).</p>\n<p>The true hero of the course is the logos (\"word\") of reasoned expression, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or \"slow\") reading, which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer's epics and ends with Plato's memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations.</p>\n<p>Using modern technology and engaging texts, <em>The Ancient Greek Hero </em>provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature, its myths, and its ritual practices.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>Earn academic credit for this course through\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/concepts-hero-classical-greek-civilization?utm_source=edx.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ancientgreek\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Extension School</a>:\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p>Academic credit can be earned for this course by completing additional work through Harvard Extension School in conjunction with the course materials on edX.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/13404?utm_source=edx.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ancientgreek\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more...</a></p></span>"], "name": ["The Ancient Greek Hero"], "url": "https://edx.org//course/harvardx/harvardx-cb22-1x-ancient-greek-hero-1047", "school": ["HarvardX"], "length": ["17 weeks"], "prereqs": ["No previous knowledge of Greek history, literature, or language is required.

This course will examine architecture through time, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological, it is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural \"moments.\" The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook <em>A Global History of Architecture</em>. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? These are typical questions that the lectures will address.</p>\n<p>All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of Wiley.

The course traces the cascade of energy from sunlight to its final destination in a thermal form, considering differential surface heating, the role of convection and buoyancy and the formation of the Earth\u2019s circulation system, and the links to the ocean circulation system.

By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students\u2019 understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students\u2019 horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.</p>\n<p>\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6240\u6d89\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6db5\u76d6\u53e4\u5178\u97f3\u4e50\u5982\u65b0\u53e4\u5178\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u8868\u73b0\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u6c11\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u7b49\u6d41\u6d3e\uff0c\u4e5f\u5bf9\u7235\u58eb\u4e50\u3001\u6447\u6eda\u4e50\u4e0e\u6d41\u884c\u97f3\u4e50\u572820\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u60c5\u72b6\u6295\u4ee5\u6df1\u5207\u5173\u6ce8\uff1b\u5728\u5c06\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u56fd\u97f3\u4e50\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u56fd\u6c11\u65cf\u6c11\u95f4\u97f3\u4e50\u7eb3\u516520\u4e16\u7eaa\u5927\u80cc\u666f\u4e88\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e4b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u7efc\u5408\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u4f8b\u5982\u6b4c\u5267\u3001\u97f3\u4e50\u5267\u3001\u7535\u5f71\u97f3\u4e50\u7684\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bbe\u4e3a\u4e13\u9898\uff0c\u7edd\u65e0\u504f\u5e9f\u3002</p>\n<p>\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4ee520\u4e16\u7eaa\u897f\u65b9\u97f3\u4e50\u4e3a\u4e3b\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u8d2f\u7a7f\u5386\u53f2\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u4fa7\u91cd\u53f2\u89c2\u53d1\u5c55\u4e4b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c24\u4e3a\u5f3a\u8c03\u97f3\u4e50\u8046\u542c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57f9\u517b\uff0c\u589e\u8fdb\u97f3\u4e50\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5f00\u8bfe\u7406\u5ff5\u3002\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u97f3\u4e50\u3001\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f20\u4e16\u7eaa\u897f\u65b9\u97f3\u4e50\u3001\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u6709\u6548\u8046\u542c\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u8bfe\u6838\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u751f\u63a2\u67e5\u5173\u4e8e20\u4e16\u7eaa\u897f\u65b9\u97f3\u4e50\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u8046\u542c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u5bf9\u5173\u4e8e20\u4e16\u7eaa\u897f\u65b9\u97f3\u4e50\u6587\u5316\u8bf8\u591a\u73b0\u8c61\u5f62\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u591a\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5b66\u751f\u5f00\u62d3\u773c\u754c\u3001\u89e6\u7c7b\u65c1\u901a\u3001\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u4ea4\u53c9\u3001\u521b\u9020\u529b\u4e4b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4eba\u683c\u4e4b\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u800c\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u3002</p>\n<p>The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy. \u8be5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u662f\u201c\u5317\u5927-\u5fb7\u7a3b\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u653e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u201d\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u95e8\uff0c\u7531\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u4e0e\u5fb7\u7a3b\u6559\u80b2\u8054\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002</p></span>"], "name": ["Music in the 20th Century"], "url": "https://edx.org//course/pekingx/pekingx-04332960x-music-20th-century-1097", "school": ["PekingX"], "length": ["12 weeks"], "prereqs": ["The only requirement is an interest and curiosity about music; no previous knowledge of music is required."], "video": ["http://www.youtube.com/v/ixSANl1baes?version=3&amp;autohide=1"], "courseCode": ["04332960X"], "instructor": ["Bryan Minghui"], "effort": []},
