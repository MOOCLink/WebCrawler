That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.</p>\n<p><em>Image: Hands at the Cuevas de las Manos upon R\u00edo Pinturas, near the town of Perito Moreno in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.

This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems. It also discusses the basic ideas behind the experimental realization of quantum computers, including the prospects for adiabatic quantum optimization and the D-Wave controversy.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p></span>"], "name": ["Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation"], "url": "https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-cs-191x-quantum-mechanics-1033", "school": ["UC BerkeleyX"], "length": ["9 weeks"], "prereqs": ["A strong background in basic linear algebra, including vectors, matrices, complex numbers, inner products, eigenvalues and eigenvectors (a simple diagnostic quiz will help you assess your background).

This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.\u00a0 Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law \u2013 in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward \u2013 to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor \u2013 a natural d\u00e0o.</p>\n<p>We will look at two rival directions this natural d\u00e0o model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the d\u00e0o of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance \u2013 Medieval Chinese Buddhism.</p>\n<p>Although Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.</p></span>"], "name": ["Humanity and Nature in Chinese Thought"], "url": "https://www.edx.org/course/hkux/hkux-hku03x-humanity-nature-chinese-1981", "school": ["HKUx"], "length": ["10 weeks"], "prereqs": [], "video": ["http://www.youtube.com/v/M1LBMzXXKq4?version=3&amp;autohide=1"], "courseCode": ["HKU03x"], "instructor": ["Chad Hansen"], "effort": ["2-3 hours/week "]},

By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students\u2019 understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students\u2019 horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.</p>\n<p>\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6240\u6d89\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6db5\u76d6\u53e4\u5178\u97f3\u4e50\u5982\u65b0\u53e4\u5178\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u8868\u73b0\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u6c11\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u7b49\u6d41\u6d3e\uff0c\u4e5f\u5bf9\u7235\u58eb\u4e50\u3001\u6447\u6eda\u4e50\u4e0e\u6d41\u884c\u97f3\u4e50\u572820\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u60c5\u72b6\u6295\u4ee5\u6df1\u5207\u5173\u6ce8\uff1b\u5728\u5c06\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u56fd\u97f3\u4e50\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u56fd\u6c11\u65cf\u6c11\u95f4\u97f3\u4e50\u7eb3\u516520\u4e16\u7eaa\u5927\u80cc\u666f\u4e88\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e4b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u7efc\u5408\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u4f8b\u5982\u6b4c\u5267\u3001\u97f3\u4e50\u5267\u3001\u7535\u5f71\u97f3\u4e50\u7684\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bbe\u4e3a\u4e13\u9898\uff0c\u7edd\u65e0\u504f\u5e9f\u3002</p>\n<p>\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4ee520\u4e16\u7eaa\u897f\u65b9\u97f3\u4e50\u4e3a\u4e3b\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u8d2f\u7a7f\u5386\u53f2\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u4fa7\u91cd\u53f2\u89c2\u53d1\u5c55\u4e4b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c24\u4e3a\u5f3a\u8c03\u97f3\u4e50\u8046\u542c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57f9\u517b\uff0c\u589e\u8fdb\u97f3\u4e50\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5f00\u8bfe\u7406\u5ff5\u3002\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u97f3\u4e50\u3001\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f20\u4e16\u7eaa\u897f\u65b9\u97f3\u4e50\u3001\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u6709\u6548\u8046\u542c\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u8bfe\u6838\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u751f\u63a2\u67e5\u5173\u4e8e20\u4e16\u7eaa\u897f\u65b9\u97f3\u4e50\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u8046\u542c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u5bf9\u5173\u4e8e20\u4e16\u7eaa\u897f\u65b9\u97f3\u4e50\u6587\u5316\u8bf8\u591a\u73b0\u8c61\u5f62\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u591a\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5b66\u751f\u5f00\u62d3\u773c\u754c\u3001\u89e6\u7c7b\u65c1\u901a\u3001\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u4ea4\u53c9\u3001\u521b\u9020\u529b\u4e4b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4eba\u683c\u4e4b\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u800c\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u3002</p>\n<p>The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy. \u8be5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u662f\u201c\u5317\u5927-\u5fb7\u7a3b\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u653e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u201d\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u95e8\uff0c\u7531\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u4e0e\u5fb7\u7a3b\u6559\u80b2\u8054\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002</p></span>"], "name": ["Music in the 20th Century"], "url": "https://www.edx.org/course/pekingx/pekingx-04332960x-music-20th-century-1097", "school": ["PekingX"], "length": ["12 weeks"], "prereqs": ["The only requirement is an interest and curiosity about music; no previous knowledge of music is required."], "video": ["http://www.youtube.com/v/ixSANl1baes?version=3&amp;autohide=1"], "courseCode": ["04332960X"], "instructor": ["Bryan Minghui"], "effort": []},

Students are welcome to audit the course, and participate in all course activities. Certificates will not be issued.</em></p>\n<p>Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level, whether it\u2019s the pressure to perform in school or work, relationship problems, financial difficulties, or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn\u2019t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one\u2019s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. This captures the notion of being from the inside out, which is a phrase that highlights the importance of promoting core resilience skills, strategies, and routines among early childhood educators. In turn, resilient people are more capable of creating and maintaining nurturing, supportive, and effective learning environments while also optimizing their own wellbeing and love for both the big and small things in life.</p>\n<p>By the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.</p>\n<p><u>Course goal:</u></p>\n<p>The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person.

That question is at the core of <em>The Ancient Greek Hero</em>, which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging, highly comparative way.</p>\n<p>The classical Greeks' concepts of Heroes and the \"heroic\" were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.</p>\n<p>In Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship \u2013 a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.</p>\n<p>The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more, including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue \"On Heroes\" by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation, with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda, including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach's opera <em>Tales of Hoffman</em> to Ridley Scott's science fiction classic <em>Blade Runner</em>).</p>\n<p>The true hero of the course is the logos (\"word\") of reasoned expression, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or \"slow\") reading, which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer's epics and ends with Plato's memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations.</p>\n<p>Using modern technology and engaging texts, <em>The Ancient Greek Hero </em>provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature, its myths, and its ritual practices.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>Earn academic credit for this course through\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/concepts-hero-classical-greek-civilization?utm_source=edx.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ancientgreek\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Extension School</a>:\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p>Academic credit can be earned for this course by completing additional work through Harvard Extension School in conjunction with the course materials on edX.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/13404?utm_source=edx.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ancientgreek\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more...</a></p></span>"], "name": ["The Ancient Greek Hero"], "url": "https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cb22-1x-ancient-greek-hero-1047", "school": ["HarvardX"], "length": ["17 weeks"], "prereqs": ["No previous knowledge of Greek history, literature, or language is required.

Texts range from theological verse dramas to intimate love poems, \u00a0from meditations on nature, family and death to reflections on the civic and communal hopes of the New England migrants. Students will be exposed to relevant poetic forms and traditions, \u00a0to rare manuscript and printed materials, and they will have opportunities to practice and refine the way they read, and write about, poems. Course materials include video lectures, roundtable and online discussions--but also interactive exercises and interpretive expeditions to key New England sites.</p>\n<p>Poetry in America surveys nearly 400 years of poetry in America. \u00a0Treating individual figures (Poe, Whitman, Dickinson, Frost, Williams, Hughes), major poetic movements (Firesides, Modernist, New York, Confessional, L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E) and probing the many uses of poetry across changing times, the course provides a historical time line for the American poetic tradition while also giving students tools to approach any poetic tradition. Who, and what, are poems for? For poets? Readers? To give vent to the soul? To paint or sculpt with words? Alter consciousness? Raise cultural tone? Students will read, engage with, write about and also recite and record American poems.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p></span>"], "name": ["Poetry in America: The Poetry of Early New England"], "url": "https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-ai12-1x-poetry-america-poetry-937", "school": ["HarvardX"], "length": ["4 weeks"], "prereqs": ["None."], "video": ["http://www.youtube.com/v/qkgTub9pB9A?version=3&amp;autohide=1"], "courseCode": ["AI12.1x"], "instructor": ["Elisa New", "Seth Herbst", "Leah Reis-Dennis", "Dave Weimer", "Sharon Howell", "Ari Hoffman", "John North Radway", "Carra Glatt"], "effort": ["3-5 hours/week"]},

Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited.</p>\n<p>In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors including topics such as probabilistic state estimation, linear control, and path planning. You will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings, how to navigate along a series of waypoints, and how to plan collision free trajectories. The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. The programming exercises will require you to write small code snippets in Python to make a quadrotor fly in simulation.</p>\n<p>This course is intended for graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering.
